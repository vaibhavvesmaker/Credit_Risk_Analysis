# AI-Driven Credit Risk Analysis and Mitigation

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at enhancing **Mastercard's credit risk assessment** capabilities by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. It focuses on analyzing Mastercard's financial data to uncover subtle or underexplored risk patterns that traditional credit risk models might miss. By applying advanced AI models to credit data, the project seeks to improve risk prediction accuracy and provide early warnings for potential defaults. Ultimately, this AI-driven approach will help Mastercard refine its risk strategy, leading to better credit decisions and reduced financial losses. 
 
## Key Features
- **Underexplored Risk Identification**: Analyzes Mastercard's financial datasets to identify underexplored or hidden credit risk factors that may not be evident through conventional analysis.
- **AI-Enhanced Prediction**: Leverages AI and machine learning models (e.g., gradient boosting and deep neural networks) to predict credit risk with greater accuracy and confidence.
- **Agile Methodology**: Implements an agile development process with structured sprints, allowing iterative improvements, quick feedback, and adaptive planning throughout the project.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Includes comprehensive data analysis and visualizations to support findings, helping stakeholders visualize risk trends and key indicators for informed decision-making.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Processing
We gathered a rich dataset from Mastercard's financial records, including credit card transaction histories, account balances, customer profiles, and historical default data. All data were **cleaned and pre-processed** to handle missing values, outliers, and to ensure anonymization where necessary. We then split the data into training and testing sets for model development. This step also involved balancing the dataset (through techniques like undersampling or SMOTE) if the incidence of credit defaults was low, ensuring that the models receive sufficient examples of risky and non-risky cases for learning.

### AI Models Used
We experimented with several machine learning algorithms to model credit risk, including logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, and deep learning neural networks. **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, was a strong performer in our tests – consistent with industry benchmarks that show XGBoost often achieves top accuracy in credit default prediction ([GitHub - maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML: Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning models](https://github.com/maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML#:~:text=Model%20Accuracy%20Logistic%20Regression%200,9734)). We also built a deep neural network to capture complex nonlinear patterns in the data. After extensive evaluation, the final solution uses an **ensemble of models** (with XGBoost as a primary model) to maximize prediction performance and robustness. Each model was tuned via cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters (for example, tree depth and learning rate for XGBoost, and network architecture for the neural net).

### Feature Engineering and Risk Factor Analysis
Significant effort went into feature engineering to derive informative risk factors from raw data. We created features such as **credit utilization ratio** (current balance vs. credit limit), **payment history metrics** (e.g., count of late payments, average days past due), transaction behavior features (spending variability, merchant category patterns), and customer profile features (tenure, credit score bands, etc.). We then analyzed feature importance using the trained XGBoost model and SHAP values to interpret the model's decisions. This analysis confirmed that traditional factors like **credit score and credit limit utilization** are among the most influential predictors of default risk ([GitHub - maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML: Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning models](https://github.com/maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML#:~:text=significant%20variables%20in%20predicting%20credit,their%20losses%20due%20to%20defaults)). Some attributes (for example, a customer's age) turned out to be less significant for prediction, reinforcing the need to focus on behavioral and financial features over basic demographics ([GitHub - maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML: Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning models](https://github.com/maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML#:~:text=significant%20variables%20in%20predicting%20credit,their%20losses%20due%20to%20defaults)). These insights not only improved the model but also provided business analysts with a better understanding of risk drivers.

### Deployment and Monitoring
The project includes a deployment strategy to integrate the AI models into Mastercard’s existing risk management infrastructure. We packaged the best-performing model into a microservice API, enabling real-time or batch scoring of credit risk for incoming credit card applications or portfolio reviews. The deployment pipeline involves containerization (using Docker) for portability and uses a CI/CD process to ensure that new model versions can be tested and rolled out smoothly. We also set up monitoring tools to track the model’s performance in production – including metrics like prediction accuracy, false positives/negatives, and data drift over time. Alerts are configured so that if the model’s performance falls below a threshold or if input data characteristics shift significantly, the team is notified to review and update the model. This ensures the AI-driven system remains reliable and continues to add value long after initial implementation.

## Implementation Steps

To set up and use the credit risk analysis model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using `git`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-credit-risk-mastercard.git
   ```
   Then navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-credit-risk-mastercard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will install all necessary Python libraries (such as pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning, etc.).

3. **Prepare the Data**: Obtain the relevant Mastercard credit risk dataset (due to confidentiality, actual Mastercard data is not provided in this repository; however, you can use the provided *sample dataset* or your own data in the same format). Place your data file (e.g., `mastercard_credit_data.csv`) in the `data/` directory. Make sure the dataset includes all the features required by the model (credit history, account info, etc.) and has a target column indicating default or risk outcome.

4. **Configure Settings (if needed)**: Check the `config.py` (or similar configuration file) for any model parameters or file path settings. You can adjust thresholds (for risk classification), select which model to use (XGBoost vs. neural network), or other settings here before running the model.

5. **Train the Model** (optional): If you want to train the model from scratch on your data, run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --data data/mastercard_credit_data.csv
   ```
   This will process the data, train the machine learning model(s), and save the trained model to a file (e.g., `models/credit_risk_model.pkl`). You can adjust training options via command-line arguments (see `python train_model.py --help` for details). Training logs and metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, etc.) will be output to the console, and a summary report may be saved to `reports/training_report.txt`.

6. **Run Credit Risk Prediction**: If you want to use the pre-trained model (or after training your own), you can run the prediction script on new data:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/new_applicants.csv --output results/predictions.csv
   ```
   Here, `new_applicants.csv` is an example input file containing new credit card applicants or accounts with the same features as the training data (but without the target). The script will load the saved model and output risk predictions for each record in the input file. The results (in `results/predictions.csv`) will include a risk score or category for each account, indicating the likelihood of default or risk level. Higher scores indicate higher credit risk. 

7. **Explore Data Insights** (optional): For a deeper dive, open the Jupyter notebook `Credit_Risk_Analysis.ipynb` included in the repository. This notebook contains an interactive walkthrough of the data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It also generates some plots of feature importance and performance (ROC curve, confusion matrix). To run the notebook, execute:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Credit_Risk_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
   and follow along with the commentary and visuals for a better understanding of the model's behavior and the data-driven insights.

After following these steps, you should be able to reproduce the model training and see how the AI-driven credit risk analysis works. The expected output is a set of risk scores or classifications for each account in the input data, along with logs or reports detailing model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision/recall, AUC).

## Results and Business Impact

**Model Performance**: During evaluation, the AI models demonstrated significant improvements in credit risk prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods. For instance, the XGBoost model achieved high accuracy in identifying potential credit defaults, outperforming baseline models like logistic regression. The ensemble approach further improved stability of predictions. The analysis of feature importances revealed that financial behavior features (such as high credit utilization and history of late payments) were strong indicators of risk, whereas some demographic factors had minimal impact – aligning with domain intuition ([GitHub - maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML: Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning models](https://github.com/maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML#:~:text=significant%20variables%20in%20predicting%20credit,their%20losses%20due%20to%20defaults)). We also evaluated the model using cross-validation and held-out test sets, ensuring it generalizes well to new data. Key evaluation metrics included **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**, which was excellent (indicating strong discrimination between risky and non-risky accounts), and **Precision-Recall** performance, which showed the model effectively balances catching high-risk cases while minimizing false alarms.

**Business Impact**: Implementing this AI-driven risk model can have a substantial positive impact on Mastercard's credit risk management strategy. With more accurate risk predictions, Mastercard can **proactively identify high-risk customers** and take mitigating actions (such as adjusting credit limits, requiring additional verification, or offering tailored repayment plans) before those accounts default. This early intervention is expected to reduce credit losses and delinquency rates. Moreover, by uncovering underexplored risk factors and new patterns, the model provides insights for refining risk policies – for example, it might highlight if certain transaction behaviors are early warnings of trouble, enabling Mastercard to update its risk scoring criteria. In addition, better credit risk assessment indirectly helps in fraud reduction: some fraudulent behaviors can be detected as anomalies in the data patterns that the model flags as high risk. Overall, by using machine learning techniques like the ones in this project, financial institutions can better **identify and manage credit risk, potentially reducing their losses due to defaults and fraud** ([GitHub - maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML: Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning models](https://github.com/maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML#:~:text=significant%20variables%20in%20predicting%20credit,their%20losses%20due%20to%20defaults)). Internally, Mastercard’s risk analysts and decision-makers can use the model’s outputs and insights to make more informed, data-driven decisions, leading to a more resilient credit portfolio and improved customer management.

## Future Enhancements
The current project lays a strong foundation, but there are several avenues for future improvement and extension:

- **Model Enhancements**: Experiment with additional machine learning models and ensembling strategies. For example, trying algorithms like Support Vector Machines or other gradient boosting variants (LightGBM, CatBoost) and more complex deep learning architectures could further improve performance ([GitHub - maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML: Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning models](https://github.com/maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML#:~:text=Future%20development%20in%20this%20area,further%20improve%20credit%20risk%20analysis)). Tuning the hyperparameters extensively or using automated machine learning (AutoML) could also yield better models. Additionally, focusing on model interpretability techniques (like LIME or more advanced SHAP analysis) can help validate and trust the model’s decisions in a business setting.
- **Alternative Data Sources**: Integrate alternative and granular data sources to enrich the credit risk analysis. Future research can explore using data such as customer **social media footprint, online behavior**, or macro-economic indicators to enhance the model's predictive power ([GitHub - maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML: Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning models](https://github.com/maixbach/credit-risk-analysis-using-ML#:~:text=and%20Deep%20Learning%2C%20among%20others,further%20improve%20credit%20risk%20analysis)). For instance, incorporating economic trends or location-based risk factors might help the model anticipate external influences on credit risk. All new data would be carefully vetted for compliance and privacy, especially given financial data sensitivities.
- **Real-Time Risk Scoring**: Evolve the system into a real-time risk scoring engine. This involves optimizing the model for low-latency predictions so that Mastercard can evaluate the credit risk of transactions or new applications instantly (e.g., at the point of sale or during an online application). Techniques like model distillation or lightweight neural networks could be considered to deploy on-edge or in real-time decision platforms.
- **Wider Financial Applications**: Adapt and apply the same AI-driven approach to other financial risk domains. The methodology from this project could be expanded beyond credit card risk to areas such as **loan default risk, mortgage risk assessment, or credit line management** for different customer segments (retail, small business, etc.). It can also complement fraud detection systems by sharing features or anomaly detection components. Exploring these applications can maximize the ROI of the developed solution and contribute to a unified risk management framework across Mastercard.
